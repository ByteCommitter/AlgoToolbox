/*
Initially there are n distinct nodes. You are also given q queries, each of which represents 2 nodes
being joined by adding an edge between them, find the total number of connected components in
the graph after each query.
Input
The first line of input contains two space separated integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 105
).
The following q lines of input each contains 2 integers u and v, which represent the nodes being
joined (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n).
Output
The output should contain q integers representing the number of connected components after the
corresponding query.
