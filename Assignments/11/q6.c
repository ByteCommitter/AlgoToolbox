/*You are a thief planning to rob a store. However, you can only carry a limited weight in your
bag. The store contains n items, each with a certain weight wi and value vi
. Your objective is
to maximize the total value of items you can carry without exceeding the weight limit W of your bag.
Given the weight and value of each item, implement an algorithm to determine the maximum
total value you can obtain. You are allowed to take fractional units of items.
Input
The input consists of two integers n and W (1 ≤ n ≤ 103
, 1 ≤ W ≤ 106
), representing the number
of items in the store and the maximum weight your bag can carry, respectively.
This is followed by n lines, each containing two integers wi and vi (1 ≤ wi ≤ 106
, 1 ≤ vi ≤ 106
),
representing the weight and value of the i
th item.
Output
Output a single real number, representing the maximum total value you can obtain by optimally
selecting items and possibly taking fractional units of items.
