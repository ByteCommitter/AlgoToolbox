How to recognise the type of problems that come under KnapSack?

Instead of having two arrays, we could have a single array as well
Given a number of items, when we have a choice of taking it or not and a target to reach
Then it's a knapsack pattern


Similar problems to the knapSack problem:
1.Subset problem
2.Equal Sum Partition
3.Count of Subset Sum
4.Minimum subset sum difference
5.Target Sum
6.#. of subsets with given difference
