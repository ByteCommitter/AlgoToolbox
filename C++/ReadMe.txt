Important Note:

Several of the problems solved here may use STL or in other words standard template library, which is a standard method of tools or procedures we could use to easily deal
with some problems

Important STL to know:
1.Vectors
2.Sets
3.MultiSets
4.Priority_Queues
5.Maps

DisClaimer: 
It's important that while you know these data strcutures and the methods that they provide, they must be seen as a shortcut to save your time implementing these methods
in an atmosphere. It almost got to a point where some of us weren't able to sort an array, because of our excessive dependence on using a sort function.
